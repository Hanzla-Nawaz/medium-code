## Overview

Welcome to my repository! Here, I share all the code used in my Medium articles. Each article is paired with a Jupyter Notebook, which you can run locally or directly on Google Colab. These notebooks cover a range of topics, including machine learning, data science, NLP, and Genai. My goal is to make the learning process as accessible and reproducible as possible.
